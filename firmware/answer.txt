CAN
Q1: 
    Primary advantages - reliable, low-cost, supports real-time communication, low power
    Primary disadvantages - limited bandwidth and data payloads

    USB and PCIe are more advantageous for bulk/high-speed data. SPI works better
    in short range applications with a focus on extreme speed.

Q2:
    For the above mentioned reasons and likely largely due to cost (being a student 
    led team with limited funding) and widespread adoption in the automotive industry 
    making troubleshooting easier.

STM32 Chip Selection

STM32F765BI (High-performance and DSP with FPU, Arm Cortex-M7 MCU with 2 
Mbytes of Flash memory, 216 MHz CPU, Art Accelerator, L1 cache, SDRAM, DFSDM)

This chip meets the desired requirements. No available chip exceeded them.
